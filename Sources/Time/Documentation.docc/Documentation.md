# ``Time``

Robust and type-safe date and time calculations.

## Overview

Date and time programming is hard. Time is swift package based on more than a decade of experience solving real-world calendaring problems.

**Time** is built on top of Apple's [Foundation framework](https://github.com/apple/swift-foundation) and provides a robust and type-safe API for working with dates and times in code. Where possible, **Time** guides programmers down the correct path of manipulating values, so that the resulting answers are calendrically correct and match user expectations.
