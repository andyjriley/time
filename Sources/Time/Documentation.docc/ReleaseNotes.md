#  Release Notes

A brief history of **Time**.

## 1.0.0

29 February, 2024 - The initial release of **Time**.

In particular, thanks go to [Daniel Kennett][ikenndac], [Nathan Harris][mordil], [Reed Harston][rtharston], [Noah Blake][nononoah], and [Francis Chary][churowa] for their comments and suggestions on the 1.0 API and feature set, and especially for putting up with a constant stream of questions and requests for feedback. Additionally, a huge thanks to [Tim Vermeulen][timvermeulen] for helping formalize **Time**'s type safety via an astoundingly clever application of protocols.
